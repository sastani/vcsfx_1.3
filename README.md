# vcsfx_1.3
Basic version control system developed for CECS 343 Software Engineering class. Implements basic functions of a version control system: 

Functions:

1) Create new repo

2) Check in a project

3) Check out a project

4) Merge (sets up manual merge).

Automerge yet to be implemented.

Originally developed in C++, later updated to Java.

Multiplatform: Supports Windows and Unix operating systems (Linux/MacOS)
Requires the use of an external Jar file from Apache (Apache Commons IO) to allow the use
of the FileUtils.copy() method. Use of external libraries (outside of Java standard library) is thus very minimal.
